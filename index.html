                    <p>Flock is a privately owned company that operates a nationwide network of Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) cameras.

                        <p>Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) are AI-powered cameras that capture and analyze images of all passing vehicles, storing details like your car's location, date, and time. They also capture your car's make, model, color, and identifying features such as dents, roof racks, and bumper stickers, often turning these into searchable data points. These cameras collect data on millions of vehiclesâ€”regardless of whether the driver is suspected of a crime. While these systems can be useful for tracking stolen cars or wanted individuals, they are mostly used to track the movements of innocent people.</p>

                        <p>ALPRs are a serious risk to your privacy and civil liberties. These systems continuously record people's movements, often without a warrant, probable cause, or even reasonable suspicion. Your driving history is rarely confined to the town or city where the cameras are installed. It's typically shared with thousands of other agencies nationwide (secretly). Once the data is out of your community, you have no control over how it's used or what rules apply. And once this kind of tracking infrastructure exists, there are no guarantees it will only be used against criminals.</p>

                        <p>Flock claims our data is safe, but Flock&rsquo;s system is designed for mass sharing. The data can be saved indefinitely and shared with hundreds of outside agencies, including ICE, putting our immigrant neighbors at direct risk.</p>
