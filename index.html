        <h2>What is Flock?</h2>
        <p>Flock is a privately owned company that operates a nationwide network of Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) cameras. <em>Flock is building a database of where everyone travels, accessible without a warrant, regardless of whether you have committed a crime.</em> They have been used by ICE<sup><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/investigations/investigators/federal-immigration-accessed-washington-state-license-plate-readers/281-93b1edfe-f761-4e3f-9118-ed72e04c1864">[1]</a></sup> in violation of Washington law. They have been used to track women<sup><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it">[2]</a></sup> who sought reproductive healthcare. They have been used to stalk partners of law enforcement<sup><a href="https://www.kwch.com/2022/10/31/kechi-police-lieutenant-arrested-using-police-technology-stalk-wife/">[3]</a><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kansas-police-chief-used-flock-093300946.html">[4]</a><a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2024/02/16/las-vegas-police-officer-arrested-reportedly-stalking-ex-fiancee/?outputType=amp">[5]</a></sup></p>

        <h3><strong>Your Location Data is Not Safe from Misuse and Sharing</strong></h3>



<p>Flock claims our data is safe, but Flock&rsquo;s system is designed for mass sharing. The data can be saved indefinitely and shared with hundreds of outside agencies, including ICE, putting our immigrant neighbors at direct risk.</p>



<ul>
<li>A 2023 report found that ICE accessed license plate data from sanctuary cities, undermining state law and local trust<sup><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/">[8]</a></sup>.</li>



<li>Federal agencies have been found to use logins provided by local law enforcement to circumvent restrictions on federal information sharing<sup><a href="https://unraveledpress.com/a-dea-agent-used-an-illinois-police-officers-flock-license-plate-reader-password-for-unauthorized-immigration-enforcement-searches/">[9]</a></sup>.</li>



<li>Similar systems have been hacked, resulting in exposure of their databases<sup><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/02/border-surveillance-subcontractor-suspended-after-cyberattack-misuse-traveler-images/">[10]</a></sup>.</li>



<li>Many cities are ending their contracts specifically to concerns that data will be used against our neighbors<sup><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/communities-across-country-reject-automated-license-plate-readers">[11]</a></sup>.</li>
